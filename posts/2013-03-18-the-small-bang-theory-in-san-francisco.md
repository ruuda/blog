During the Game Developers Conference next week,
the Dutch Game Garden will host [INDIGO @ GDC](http://dutchgamegarden.nl/indigo/editions/gdc2013).
One of the games on display there, will be _The Small Bang Theory_,
the award-winning game I and my team developed during the Global Game Jam 2012.
If you happen to be in San Francisco between 25 and 30 March,
be sure to drop by the Dutch Consulate!
