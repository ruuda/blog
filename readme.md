Blog
====

This is the source code for [my personal site][ruudva]. It is a static site
generated by a homemade generator written in Haskell.

[![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

The generator includes a tiny templating engine, an html and css minifier, and
an aggressive font subsetter. One of my objectives was to cut all the crap
(which almost by definition includes javascript) without compromising on
design. An average page of my site weighs less than jQuery alone (which
jokingly describes itself as “lightweight footprint”). That includes webfonts.

This is version three of my blog. Previously I used [Hakyll][hakyll] (available
in the `archived-hakyll` branch), and before that I used [Jekyll][jekyll].

Compiling
---------
Install Python requirements (for font subsetting) in a virtualenv:

    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Build the generator, then build the site (requires fonts to be present):

    $ stack setup
    $ stack build
    $ stack exec blog
