Blog
====

This is the source code for [my personal site][ruudva]. It is a static site
generated by a homemade generator written in Haskell.

The generator includes a tiny templating engine, an html and css minifier, and
an aggressive font subsetter. One of my objectives was to cut all the crap
(which almost by definition includes javascript) without compromising on
design. An average page of my site weighs less than jQuery alone (which
describes itself as “lightweight footprint”). That includes webfonts.

This is version three of my blog. Previously I used [Hakyll][hakyll] (available
in the `archived-hakyll` branch), and before that I used [Jekyll][jekyll].

Compiling
---------

All dependencies are available in a [Nix][nix] ≥ 2.14 development environment
that you can enter with

    $ nix develop --command $SHELL

This will bring a `python3` on the path with the right requirements for font
subsetting, as well as the blog generator itself, and tools for compressing
images.

The generator gets built as part of the development environment, but you can
also compile it manually with GHC if you like. Then build the site (requires
fonts to be present):

    $ ghc -o blog src/*.hs # Optional
    $ blog
